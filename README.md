# NLP
The point of this repository is to learn a bit about natural language processing, and try to implement some relevant algorithms in python. 
For some of the code the book _Applied Text Analysis with Python_ by Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, and Tony Ojeda 
(Oâ€™Reilly) have been used to see how the code can be implemented.
